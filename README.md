# Motivation
With the outbreak of COVID-19, our daily life has been changed a lot and now we get used to keeping a social distancing. For each state government, however, it is important to know the effectiveness of social distancing regarding COVID 19. Will social distancing prevent spreading the COVID 19? Is there any correlation between?  From a data analytics view, I will do some analysis on the relationship between social distancing and  COVID-19 case numbers.

# Goal of Project
Based on 2 datasets - social distancing and COVID-19 case number, will apply Python and SQL to analyze the correlation between these 2 datasets. Finally, I will use Tableau to visualize the results.
