# Problem
As one of the biggest pandemics so far, COVID 19 has changed our daily life and even create a new word - social distancing. To each state government and the individual live in the state, it is important to know whether social distancing really works. 

My project will provide visualization to show whether there is any relationship between COVID 19 and peopleâ€™s mobility. 

# Goal/Solutions of Project
Based on 2 datasets - social distancing and COVID-19 case number, I will apply PySpark and SQL to clean the data and analyze the relationship between COVID 19 and people's mobility, to find out whether keeping social distancing is helpful for preventing the spread of COVID 19. Finally, I will use Tableau to visualize the results.
