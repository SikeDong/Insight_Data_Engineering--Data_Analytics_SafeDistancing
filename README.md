# Insight-Data-Engineering---Where-to-Live
Insight Data Engineering Project

# Motivation
For international students, the first issue they need to solve is to find a right place to live. However, as they could come here to check or know little about the market in the States, it is hard for them. The purpose of this project is to help international students find a right place to live during they study here.
Project location: Place might be: CA or NY or Boston
