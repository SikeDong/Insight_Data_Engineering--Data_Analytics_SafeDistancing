# Insight-Data-Engineering---Where-to-Live
Insight Data Engineering Project

# Motivation
Living community is very important, especially with the outbreak of COVID 19, the way people choose a place to live now might need to change. In addition to safety and convenience, nowadays, under COVID 19 pandemic, we might also need to consider while people do social distancing when it is necessary and how serious the pandemic is. My platform is to allow people, including students or house buyers to filter the place they plan to live by knowing safety, environment, and also the COVID-19 situation so that they can have a better idea.

# Goal of Project
It will be a platform for people(house buyers, renters, students) to know where to live. They can filter the area(s) by several choices, including the number of COVID 19 cases, how social distancing goes(this I need to figure out more), how many bus stations, how many metro stations, crime index, etc. By choosing the preferred choices, the area(s) on the map will pop up(in deeper or different colors), then the people can know this, or these can be the potential areas that I could consider to live.

Datasets: Social distancing, census data, COVID-19 case numbers, crime index, transportation data,  geo data(distance to school), hospital nearby, retail stores, and etc.
